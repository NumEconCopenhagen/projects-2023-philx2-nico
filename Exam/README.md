# Exam Project

This project is made by Philip Gade Reumert, Philip Engel and Nicolai MÃ¸ller.

**Dependencies**: In order to effectively execute the code, the specific dependencies must be installed:

- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Please ensure these dependencies are installed in your Python environment to enable the flawless running of the code.

Note that there might be some cells that require a long time to run. All cells should not take more than a couple of minutes. There is also some discrepancies between the use of the classes and the structure of the classes. This is because we have encountered problems with the .py file containing the classes. Small changes in the .py class would result in the fact that we were not able to import the .py file in the notebook. We apologize for this.

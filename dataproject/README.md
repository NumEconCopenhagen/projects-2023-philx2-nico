# Data analysis project

Our project is an **investigation of house prices on cottage**. This project explores the influence of location, property size and room count on house prices. It analyses these these variables in cities with the highest and lowest average prices, examining whether adjustments for property size and location impacts the cost differences. The ultimate goal in this project is to identify key trends and relationships affecting housing prices on cottage.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

To succesfully run this file it is reguired to run the [dataproject.py](dataproject.py) file.

The data for this assignment has been collected from real estate database, Nybolig. This database contains information about properties listed for sale, which include features such as the location of the property, house price, the size of the property in square meters, and the number of rooms. It's important to note that this data is a snapshot of cottage market at the time we collected our data. Due to fluctations in the market, our analysis might yield different results depending on what time you collect the data from Nybolig's database. Therefore we advice you to not run the scraper at the start of the .ipynb file or the results might not correspond to the text. 

For the purpose of this analysis, the data has been cleaned and preprocessed to handle any missing or inconsistent data.

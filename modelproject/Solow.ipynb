    "The Solow model with immigrant workers is an extension of the Solow-Swan growth model that takes into account the impact of immigration on economic growth. In this model, immigrants are treated as a separate factor of production and are assumed to have a different productivity level than native workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this model is to analyze the effect of immigration on the long-run economic growth of a country. By incorporating immigrant workers, the model can capture the impact of changes in the immigrant population on key economic variables such as output, capital accumulation, and technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Solow model with immigrant workers, the economy is assumed to produce a single good using physical capital and labor, where labor is composed of two types of workers: native and immigrant workers. The productivity of immigrant workers is assumed to be different from that of native workers, and this difference is captured by a parameter that represents the degree of substitutability between the two types of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also incorporates the dynamics of capital accumulation and technological progress, as in the original Solow-Swan model. However, the addition of immigrant workers introduces some new features, such as the effect of immigration on the savings rate, the impact of immigration on the real wage rate of native workers, and the effect of immigration on the long-run rate of economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Solow model with immigrant workers provides a framework for analyzing the impact of immigration on the long-run economic growth of a country, and can be used to inform policy decisions related to immigration and economic development."

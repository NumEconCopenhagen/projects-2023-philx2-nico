# Inaugural project

We are sorry in advance if it is unstructered / uncomplete. You need to run the .py file and run all in .ipynb then you should see the results. It may take a few seconds. We appreciate your input. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
